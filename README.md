# Morningtrain JS challenge

*By Rasmus V SÃ¸rensen (30.04.16)*

## 2 JAVASCRIPT
The Javascript challenge is, without the use of 3rd party code, to develop some code that is able to
transform an alert box into a modal popup window.
* Standard alert boxes needs to be replaced by a custom dialog box.
* It must be possible to call the functionality directly, so it can be used without going through
an alert box.
* When initializing, it must be possible to set appropriate settings
